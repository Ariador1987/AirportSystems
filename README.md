# AirportSystems
Flight Managment Module Demo App

- Fullstack (.NET API and Blazor Server)
- Layered Architecture
- Data Seeding
- Repository With Specification Pattern
- Serilog (MSSQL and File)
- AutoMapper and DTO's
- Webcompiler (for custom scss files)

WebCompiler can give issues upon project initialization - if that's the case. Clean then Build (Not rebuild, as the rebuild makes the thread freeze for some reason)
